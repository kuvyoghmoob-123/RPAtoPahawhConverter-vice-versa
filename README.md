This is a small project that I wanted to do for a quite a while. It took a lot of months or close to a year or two, from start to finish, including testing phase. It may or may not be the first converter that allow users to convert from Hmong RPA to Pahawh Hmong and vice versa. Any feedback or advices for improving are warmly welcome.

Here's the RPA to Pahawh Converter website: https://kuvyoghmoob-123.github.io/RPAtoPahawhConverter-vice-versa/
